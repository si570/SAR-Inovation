      <p>Frame: Usually constructed from lightweight materials like carbon fiber or plastic,
         the frame serves as the structure that holds the essential parts together.

        Propellers and Motors: Drones are propelled by multiple rotors powered by electric motors.
         These motors provide the necessary thrust for flight and maneuverability.
        
        Flight Controller: An onboard computer system manages the drone's flight by processing commands from the pilot or autopilot software.
         It adjusts the speed of individual motors to control movement.
        
        Sensors and Cameras: Many drones are equipped with sensors like GPS,
         accelerometers, gyroscopes, and altimeters for stabilization, navigation, and collecting data. Additionally, cameras or other imaging devices capture photos and videos.
        
        Battery: Drones rely on rechargeable lithium-polymer batteries for power,
         determining their flight duration. Advanced drones might have swappable or larger capacity batteries.</p>
